## An easy-to-use wrapper for yt-dlp, a fork for the popular download manager for video and audio.

### Usage:
Copy the URL of the desired media and run the program. <br/> You can choose between .mp4 and .mp3, and the content will automatically be downloaded at 1080p (HD). <br/> Download locations are the `Videos` folder for .mp4s and the `Music` folder for .mp3s. <br/> The program will also warn you if you try to submit something that doesn't look like a URL (although you can ignore the warning).

### Requirements:
You must download [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) in order to use this program

### Project ambition:
I made this program because I wanted the minimize the brainpower required to download a video. To be honest I don't spend a lot of time downloading videos and so I tend to forget the syntax associated with yt-dlp. This program allows me to quickly and easily download high-quality Youtube videos and audios without any hassle.
