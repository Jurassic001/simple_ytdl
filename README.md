### An easy-to-use wrapper for yt-dlp, a fork for the popular download manager for video and audio.
Pretty simple, copy the URL of the website and run the program (intended to be used with the Win + R shortcut on Windows). You can choose between .mp4 and .mp3, and the video will automatically be downloaded at 1080p (HD). Download locations are the Videos folder for .mp4s and the Music folder for .mp3s. The program will also warn you if you try to submit something that doesn't look like a URL (although you can ignore the warning).

I made this program because I wanted the minimize the brainpower required to download a video. To be honest I don't spend a lot of time downloading videos and so I tend to forget the syntax associated with yt_dlp.
