### An easy-to-use wrapper for yt-dlp, a fork for the popular download manager for video and audio.
Pretty simple, copy the URL of the website and run the program (intended to be used with the Win + R shortcut on Windows). The video will be downloaded to the Videos folder on the users computer automatically. Won't start the download if a non-URL is detected on the clipboard.

I made this program because I wanted the minimize the brainpower required to download a video. To be honest I don't spend a lot of time downloading videos and so I tend to forget the syntax associated with yt_dlp.

#### Dependencies:
pyperclip (Python package) <br/>
keyboard (Python package) <br/>
yt_dlp (Video downloader)
